> ## what is git rebase?   
>
>git rebase is a Git command used to integrate changes from one branch into another. Unlike git merge, which creates a new commit to combine changes, git rebase modifies the commit history by moving, combining, or eliminating existing commits. This can result in a cleaner and more linear project history.
